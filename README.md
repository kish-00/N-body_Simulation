For my project I created an n-body simulator to explore the chaotic effects of having more than two bodies interacting gravitationally.

# An Exploration of the N-Body Problem
In our universe, there are countless systems containing more than one body. Our solar system alone contains a star and eight
(or nine, depending on who you ask) planets, along with many smaller asteroids and debris. Our galaxy is comprised of around
200 billion stars and a super-massive black hole at its center. Where, then, lies the dilemma of having more than two bodies
n orbit? Well, these systems essentially function as independent binary systems overlaid on top on one another. Our solar system
is practically a bunch of binary systems between the sun and an individual planet; the planets themselves are not massive enough
o cause the sun to move very much and are far enough away from each other that they do not interact much with one another. The
¬n¬-body problem comes into play when the bodies in the system are all of comparable mass and interact with each of the other
bodies in the system.
